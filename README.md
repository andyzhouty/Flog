## Q & A

1. Q: Why 'Flog'?  
A: 'Flog' is a combination of 'Flask' and 'Blog'. The word sounds (and looks) like 'frog'. So I use a frog as its icon.  

2. Q: Why can't the website be updated frequently?  
The website cannot be updated on time because I'm a student in Middle School now. There is much homework.
